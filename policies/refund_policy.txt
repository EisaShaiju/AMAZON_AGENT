REFUND POLICY

Section 1: General Refund Terms
Full refunds are issued for defective, damaged, or incorrect products received by the customer. The refund amount includes the product price and any shipping charges paid.

Partial refunds may apply for used items, opened packaging, or items returned without all original accessories and documentation.

Refunds are typically processed within 5-7 business days of approval. The refund will be credited to the original payment method used during purchase.

Section 2: Delivery Delay Refunds
Orders delayed beyond 48 hours from the expected delivery date may qualify for automatic refund eligibility, provided the delay is not due to exceptional circumstances.

Customers must request a refund within 10 days of the expected delivery date to be eligible for delay-related refunds.

Delays caused by weather emergencies, natural disasters, or force majeure events are excluded from automatic refund eligibility.

Section 3: Cancellation and Refunds
Orders can be cancelled for a full refund within 24 hours of order placement, regardless of order status.

After 24 hours, cancellation fees may apply based on the current order status:
- Processing stage: No cancellation fee
- Shipped stage: Shipping charges may be deducted
- Out for delivery: 10% restocking fee may apply

Section 4: Special Cases
For orders with custom or personalized items, refunds are only issued if the product is defective or incorrect.

Digital products and gift cards are non-refundable once delivered or activated.

In cases where a refund is processed but the order is subsequently delivered, customers must return the item or be charged for it.
